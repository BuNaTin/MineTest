## 1. Motivation: ##
I want to try making a voxel engine, to improve math, CPP, and work at the graphic engine.

## 2. Small info: ##
Now core can save, and load worlds. There is a simple interaction with the world.

## 3. Users methods: ##
You can inheritance Application class and override method:
void doing();
which is built in main loop.

## 4. Coming changes: ##
I'm increasing the technology stack of engine core (yep, I stole a little). Soon I will add infinity world, lightning, and some texture improvements.
